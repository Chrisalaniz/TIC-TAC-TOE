<h1>TIC-TAC-TOE</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I developed a simple tic-tac-toe game using C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game displays a message telling the users if it is the player X's turn or the player O's turn. The users will click on a box that has not already been taken to make there move. Once the game has ended a message will display telling the users if a player has won the game or if it was a tie.
